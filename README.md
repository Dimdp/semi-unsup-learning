# Semi unsupervised learning on MNIST using Categorical GANs with Tensorflow in google colab
From the paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06390)

Training a Discriminative Classifier using small labaled data and big unlabaled data.
This notebook implements a Categorical Gan for MNIST data.
Using 100 labeled data and 59900 unlabaled data we acould achieve 95% of accuracy on the test set.
